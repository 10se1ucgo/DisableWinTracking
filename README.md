## CYRILLIC LANGUAGES WARNING

## ПРЕДУПРЕЖДЕНИЕ ДЛЯ КИРИЛЛИЧЕСКИХ ЯЗЫКОВ

**Slavic languages: Belarusian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, Rusyn, Serbo-Croatian (for Standard Serbian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin), Ukrainian.**

**Славянские языки: белорусский, болгарский, македонский, русский, русинский, сербохорватский (для стандартного сербского, боснийского и черногорского), украинский.**

This program cannot run correctly from a file path that contains Cyrillic characters. Make sure to run it from your root folder (usually C:/ ) so that you don't get runtime errors.

Эта программа не может работать корректно, если в пути к файлу есть кириллические символы. Обязательно запустите его из корневой папки ( обычно C:/ ), чтобы вы не получали ошибок во время выполнения.

## DOWNLOAD

[DOWNLOAD EXE HERE](https://github.com/10se1ucgo/DisableWinTracking/releases/)

**Note:** Windows Defender may report the EXE as a trojan (Win32/Pocyx.C!cl), and may therefore prevent you from extracting the EXE to anywhere on your computer. Set up an exclusion in **Settings > Update & Security > Windows Defender > Exclusions** by adding the folder you intend to extract the EXE to.

## How to Use

You can either:

A. [Run the binary uploaded to the Release tab as an Administrator and select which options you'd like](https://github.com/10se1ucgo/DisableWinTracking/releases/)

B. Install Python and the dependencies listed below and run the script from an elevated command prompt and select which options you'd like  

#### Silent

Either can be run with the -silent argument as of v3.1. This will perform all available options of the version you're using.

**You still need to run it as administrator.**

## Dependencies
This is only to run the script from source, [download the exe here](https://github.com/10se1ucgo/DisableWinTracking/releases/)
* Tested on Python 3.7.2 since DisableWinTracking 3.2.4 (commit [9f1d2aa](https://github.com/10se1ucgo/DisableWinTracking/commit/9f1d2aa58cec76306c3dc6887e7c9c92769936fe))
* [wxPython](http://wxpython.org/download.php)
* [PyWin32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/)
* Windows 10 (Duh)

## Methods Used

#### Telemetry

Set the `AllowTelemetry` string in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection` to `0`

#### DiagTrack Log

Clears and disables writing to the log located in `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Diagnosis\ETLLogs\AutoLogger`

#### Services

You can delete or disable the 2 services below:
* `DiagTrack` (aka. Connected User Experiences and Telemetry) Diagnostics Tracking Service
* `dmwappushsvc` WAP Push Message Routing Service

Action:
* Delete: Remove both services
* Disable: Set the `Start` registry key for both services to `4` (Disabled) Located at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\`

#### HOSTS

Append known tracking domains to the `HOSTS` file located in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`

#### IP Blocking

Blocks known tracking IPs with the Windows Firewall. The rules are named TrackingIPX, replacing X with the IP numbers.

#### Windows Defender

Disables the following:
- Automatic Sample Submission
- Delivery Optimization Download Mode
 
#### WifiSense
Disables the following:
- Credential Share
- Open-ness

#### OneDrive

Runs `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall` (64 bit) or  
`C:\Windows\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall` (32 bit)

Also disables registry entries that keep the OneDrive Icon pinned to your Windows Explorer list:

#### Xbox DVR

Action:
* Disable: Set the `GameDVR_Enabled` registry key for both services to `0` (Disabled) Located at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\System\GameConfigStore`
* Disable: Set the `AllowGameDVR` registry key for both services to `0` (Disabled) Located at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\GameDVR`

This action requires reboot computer for completely applying.

## Delete Services vs Disable Services?

Selecting "Disable" will simply stop the services from being able to run.
Selecting the "Delete" choice will completely delete the tracking services.
